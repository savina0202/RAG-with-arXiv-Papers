# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with arXiv Papers

RAG architectures allow the agent to search a structured knowledge base and generate grounded, document-aware answers. This RAG pipeline uses recent arXiv cs.CL papers, converting them into searchable chunks, embedding them, and indexing them with FAISS. A query interface is provided that takes the user's question, retrieves the top relevant chunks and displays them for further processing. 

Starting to build a private research knowledge base, and planning to be replaced by a full-featured hybrid database.
